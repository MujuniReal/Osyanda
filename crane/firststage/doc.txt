/*
  %al - number of sectors to read
  %ah - SubFunction 2 for 16bit reads from BIOS interrupts
  %ch - Low 8bits of Cylinder
  %cl - High 2bits of cylinder, 6bits for sector
  %dh - Head Number
  %dl - Drive Number from BIOS
  %es:%bx - Where read data is gonna be stored

  LBA
  Sector = (LBA mod SectsPTrack) + 1
  Head = (LBA / SectsPTrack) mod NumHeads
  Cylinder = (LBA / SectsPTrack) / NumHeads

  divide (dx:ax)/bx or any reg qoutient - %ax remainder - %dx
  Before calling this guy set %cx to 4 so dat it attempts to try wen fail
  we gonna use the cx register as our counter to count
  4 3 more trys for disk reading
  from the ax,bx,cx,dx function calling style i think
  that this function is like so diskread(No_sects,*ptrSrc,*ptrDst)
  This function expects LBA put in %ax register
